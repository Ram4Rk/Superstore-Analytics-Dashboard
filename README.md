# Power BI – Superstore Analytics Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard providing a comprehensive view of **sales, profit and returns** across products, states and customer segments.  
This project highlights data modeling, dynamic KPIs, and rich visuals using **Power BI**, **Power Query**, and **DAX**.

## About

In this project, adapted the original U.S. Superstore dataset to an Indian market scenario to practice regional analytics by modifying key fields and measures.  
I then designed and developed the dashboard from scratch, applying custom formatting and creating new KPIs and measures.  
This process helped me strengthen my **DAX** and **data modeling** skills.
